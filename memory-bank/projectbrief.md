# Project Brief

## Project Name
NixOS Flake Configuration

## Project Goal
This project aims to create a NixOS system configuration using a Nix flake structure. The primary goal is to achieve a highly reproducible, declarative, and portable NixOS setup that is easy to manage and extend. The configuration should be "Cline's Memory Bank" compatible, meaning documentation and structural patterns will facilitate future understanding and modification.

## Core Requirements
1.  **Nix Flake Structure:** The configuration must be defined as a Nix flake (`flake.nix` and `flake.lock`).
2.  **Reproducibility:** The system should be fully reproducible, ensuring the same environment can be deployed consistently across different machines or at different times.
3.  **Declarative Configuration:** All aspects of the system (packages, services, users, hardware) must be declaratively defined in Nix.
4.  **Modularity:** The configuration should be modular, allowing for easy addition/removal of features and organization into logical components (e.g., hardware configuration, user-specific settings, desktop environment).
5.  **Memory Bank Compatibility:** The project's structure, naming conventions, and internal documentation will adhere to the principles outlined in "Cline's Memory Bank" rules to ensure clarity and maintainability for future iterations or different engineers.

## Key Features to Include (Initial Scope)
*   Basic NixOS system configuration.
*   User account setup.
*   Essential development tools (e.g., git, neovim, zsh).
*   Desktop environment (e.g., Plasma or GNOME - to be decided).
*   Dotfiles management (optional, but desirable for a complete setup).

## Stakeholders
*   **User (You):** Primary beneficiary and maintainer of the NixOS configuration.
*   **Cline (AI Engineer):** Responsible for initial setup, maintenance, and future enhancements.

## Success Criteria
*   The NixOS system successfully boots and functions with the flake configuration.
*   Common development tools are installed and accessible.
*   The configuration is easy to understand and modify based on the Memory Bank documentation.
*   The system can be rebuilt and updated with `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#myhostname`.

## Out of Scope (for initial phase)
*   Highly specialized or niche software configurations.
*   Server-specific roles (e.g., web server, database server) unless explicitly requested.
*   Non-NixOS specific configuration (e.g., Docker Compose setups not integrated via Nix).

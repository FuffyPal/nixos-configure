# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on initiating the NixOS flake project. This involves setting up the basic flake structure (`flake.nix`, `flake.lock`) and defining the initial NixOS system configuration.

## Recent Changes
As of now, no functional changes have been implemented in the NixOS configuration itself. The primary changes have been the creation of the `nixos-configure/memory-bank` directory and the initial Memory Bank documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`).

## Next Steps
1.  **Create `systemPatterns.md`**: Document the architectural patterns for the NixOS flake.
2.  **Create `techContext.md`**: Detail the technologies and development setup.
3.  **Create `progress.md`**: Establish the initial progress and outstanding tasks.
4.  **Initialize Git Repository**: Set up a Git repository for version control.
5.  **Create `flake.nix`**: Define the initial structure of the Nix flake.
6.  **Define Basic NixOS Configuration**: Add a minimal `nixosConfiguration` to `flake.nix`.
7.  **Add Essential Packages**: Include a few common packages and a basic user setup.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
*   **Modularity Strategy**: How best to organize NixOS modules within the flake for scalability and readability (e.g., separating hardware, software, users, services).
*   **Dotfiles Integration**: Whether and how to manage user dotfiles within the flake.
*   **Desktop Environment Choice**: Plasma or GNOME? (User input required for this).
*   **Initial Hostname**: A default hostname will be needed for the first NixOS configuration.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
*   **Nixpkgs Overlay for Customizations**: Prefer using overlays for custom package versions or modifications.
*   **Strict Pinning**: Utilize `flake.lock` to strictly pin `nixpkgs` and other flake inputs for maximum reproducibility.
*   **Comments and Documentation**: Extensive in-line comments and clear documentation within Nix files to explain logic.

## Learnings and Project Insights
*   The `memory-bank` structure is proving useful for systematically documenting the project before diving into code.
*   Ensuring all core Memory Bank files are in place first will establish a solid foundation.

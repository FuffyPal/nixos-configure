# Progress Report

## What Works

*   **Memory Bank Setup**: All core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been successfully created with initial placeholder content. This establishes the foundational documentation for the project.
*   **Directory Structure**: The `nixos-configure/memory-bank` directory has been created, housing the project's documentation.

## What's Left to Build

The following are the immediate next steps and features to implement:

### Core Flake Structure
1.  **Initialize Git Repository**: Set up `nixos-configure` as a Git repository.
2.  **Create `flake.nix`**: Define the basic structure of the Nix flake, including `nixpkgs` and `home-manager` inputs.
3.  **Create `flake.lock`**: Generate the initial lock file to pin flake inputs.

### Basic NixOS Configuration
4.  **Host Directory**: Create `hosts/myhostname/configuration.nix` for a default system.
5.  **Minimal `configuration.nix`**: Define a minimal NixOS configuration within the flake for the initial host.
6.  **Basic User Setup**: Configure a primary user with necessary groups.
7.  **Essential Packages**: Include a set of commonly used packages (e.g., `git`, `neovim`, `zsh`, `htop`).

### Home-Manager Integration
8.  **User Home Directory**: Create `home/myusername/home.nix`.
9.  **Integrate Home-Manager**: Set up Home-Manager to manage user-specific dotfiles and packages.

### Documentation and Refinement
10. **Refine Memory Bank**: Update existing Memory Bank files with more specific details as implementation progresses.
11. **In-Code Documentation**: Add comments to Nix files to explain choices and logic.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the **initial planning and documentation phase**. The Memory Bank is established, providing a clear roadmap and context for the upcoming implementation. No functional Nix code has been written yet.

## Known Issues

*   No known issues as the implementation has not yet begun.
*   The `myhostname` and `myusername` placeholders will need to be replaced with actual values during the configuration phase.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   The decision to prioritize Memory Bank documentation before code implementation has been highly beneficial, setting a clear architectural and contextual foundation.
*   The modular structure outlined in `systemPatterns.md` (e.g., `hosts/`, `modules/`, `home/`) is confirmed as the intended approach for scalability.

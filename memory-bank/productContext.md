# Product Context

## Why this project exists
The primary motivation for this project is to leverage the power of NixOS flakes for a personal or professional NixOS setup. Traditional NixOS configurations, while declarative, can sometimes become unwieldy, especially when managing multiple machines or sharing configurations. Flakes provide a more robust, self-contained, and reproducible way to manage these configurations.

## Problems it solves
*   **Reproducibility Challenges:** Ensures that the entire system configuration, including packages, system services, and user environments, can be reproduced exactly the same way, every time, across different hardware or even after significant time has passed.
*   **Configuration Drift:** Prevents gradual inconsistencies that can arise from manual changes or unmanaged package installations.
*   **Difficulty in Sharing/Porting:** Simplifies sharing the system configuration with others or porting it to new machines, as all dependencies and configurations are self-contained within the flake.
*   **Dependency Management:** Offers superior dependency pinning and management, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
*   **Complexity Management:** Provides a structured approach to organize large NixOS configurations, making them easier to understand and maintain.

## How it should work
The NixOS flake will serve as the single source of truth for the system's configuration.
1.  **Declarative Definition:** All desired system states, from installed software to hardware settings, will be explicitly declared in Nix files within the flake.
2.  **Atomic Updates:** System updates and rollbacks will be atomic, meaning a configuration change either fully applies or fully reverts, preventing corrupted states.
3.  **Cross-System Compatibility:** While primarily focused on a single NixOS instance initially, the structure should allow for easy extension to manage multiple NixOS machines with shared and distinct configurations.
4.  **Version Control Integration:** The flake will be managed under Git, allowing for full history tracking, collaboration, and easy rollback to previous configurations.

## User experience goals
*   **Predictable System Behavior:** Users should experience a consistent and predictable operating environment.
*   **Effortless Updates:** System updates should be straightforward and reliable.
*   **Easy Customization:** Modifying system settings, installing new software, or adding new functionalities should be intuitive for anyone familiar with Nix/NixOS, guided by clear documentation.
*   **Troubleshooting Simplicity:** When issues arise, the declarative nature and version control integration should make identifying and resolving problems easier.
*   **Rapid Development Environment Setup:** New development environments or specific tools should be easily integrated and managed through the flake.
